# k50

This was originally a visualization of a complete graph, to help me express to Cosmonauts how it is better and more reliable to have more conections overall.

There is truth to the claim that if there are more connections, the nodes spam one another more.

There is also truth to the fact that the problem is more in the block gossip area than in the mempool. K50 is now an attempt to show the state of cosmos networks LIVE.

## Musical Mode

In musical mode, k50 will visualize based on audio inputs.

## Live Network Mode

In live network mode, k50 will visualize a blockchain network, specifically the one run on encryptsim mobile phones.
