        m_Untranslated: "Volumes allow you to overrides certain HDRP settings per
          Camera, this includes post-processing effects, lighting, shadows, fog,
          sky, among others. These property overrides are stored in assets on disk
          called <b>Volume Profiles.</b>\n\nThere are 3 main types of Volumes:  <b>Default,</b>
          <b>Global,</b> and <b>Local.</b>\n\n\u2022 The <b>Default Volume</b> lives
          under <b>Edit</b> > <b>Project Settings</b> > <b>Graphics</b> > <b>HDRP
          Global Settings.</b> It defines the state of all project-wide Volume properties
          affecting every Camera, in every Scene. Therefore, it is useful for setting
          properties that are consistent across your project, such as Tonemapping
          and Motion Blur, regardless of the loaded Scenes and the active Quality
          Level and Render Pipeline Asset.\n\n\u2022 A <b>Global Volume</b> lives
          inside the Scene as a Volume GameObject component. It can be considered
          as infinitely large and is useful to control properties affecting the entire
          world, such as Sky, Fog and Shadows, regardless of the Camera position.\n\n\u2022
          A <b>Local Volume</b> also lives inside the Scene as a Volume GameObject
          component, however it is used to override Volume properties within a very
          specific area of the scene via a Box, Sphere, Capsule or Mesh collider.
          Typically, the overriddes will be related to Post-processing and Exposure,
          as these can greatly vary depending on the position of the Camera in the
          Scene.\n\n\n<b>Expert tips</b>\n\nA fourth type of Volumes exists under
          <b>Edit</b> > <b>Project Settings</b> > <b>Quality</b> > <b>HDRP</b> >
          <b>Volumes.</b> This <b>Quality Volume</b> lets you define properties that
          are specific to a Render Pipeline Asset, and therefore it can be tied to
          a given Quality level and/or Platform. This may be useful for settings
          up the properties of more expensive effects, such as the Ray Tracing ones.\n\nThe
          properties set in the <b>Default Volume</b> and the <b>Quality Volume</b>
          are applied at load time, therefore they do not have a runtime cost associated
          with them. In contrast, Volume overrides defined using <b>Global</b> and
          <b>Local Volumes</b> inside the scenes are evaluated every frame. Therefore,
          it is recommended to use the <b>Default Volume</b> and optionally the <b>Quality
          Volume</b> for values that do not need to vary at runtime."
