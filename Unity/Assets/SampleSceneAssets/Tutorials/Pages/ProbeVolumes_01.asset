      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "<b>Probe Volumes,</b> also known as \"Adaptive Probe Volumes\"
          or \"APV\" for short, are a system that allows dynamic objects to receive
          indirect diffuse lighting. It shares the same goal as the <b>Light Probes
          Groups,</b> but has major differences. Some of them are listed below:\n\n\u2022
          The probe placement is automatic and based on the Scene's geometric complexity:
          more probes will be placed around geometries, whereas empty areas of the
          Scene will receive fewer probes, depending on your <b>Min and Max Probe
          Spacing</b> settings. This automatic probe placement provides huge time-saving
          opportunities.\n\n\u2022 The indirect lighting is applied per-pixel instead
          of per-object. This allows to achieve much better lighting quality and,
          in some cases, Probe Volumes can replace lightmaps, notably when the Probe
          Spacing is lower than the corresponding Lightmap Resolution.\n\n\u2022
          They can be used by the Reflection Probes to reduce indirect specular leaking.
          This is particularly useful to prevent unwanted reflections in darker or
          concave areas, without the need to place additional Reflection Probes in
          these areas.\n\n\u2022 They can affect Volumetric Fog and Screen Space
          Global Illumination.\n\n\u2022 Streaming functionalities are provided to
          support larger scenes automatically."
